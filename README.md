# Colony-Sim
Prototype for a colony sim Idea I've had


For now there is only a rudimentary AI collecting wood and delivering to the stockpile.
But it is built in a modular and scaleable way so that the AI can differantiate between different resources, and where to deliver it in the future.

I also have the first iteration of "building placement" here. which will be used for basebuilding.
